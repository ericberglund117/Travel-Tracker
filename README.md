## About The Project

This project is part of Turing Software and Designs' Front-End Program, Module 2. This project focuses on creating a travel application that can track a user's past, pending, and upcoming trips. The program is implemented with ES6 syntax and exclusively uses array-prototype methods whenever iterations are needed. Fetch APIs was used to generate data for the travelers, destinations, and trips. The user can also request a trip, requiring a Fetch POST Api. The task was to create several objects containing methods which would dynamically display a given user's data on the DOM. 

### Built With

* Node.js
* Mocha
* Chai
* Fetch API
* Webpack

### Installation

## Roadmap

The total time allotted for this project was approximately 6 days. Future features contemplated by the developers include the following:

* Updating the css styles to be more user friendly
* Adding an travel agent class to see all the travelers, determine the status of their trips, generate a 10% cut of the user trip cost, and recommend suggested activities for a specific traveler based on their destination of choice.
